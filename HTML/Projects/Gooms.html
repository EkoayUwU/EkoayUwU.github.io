            <h3>You play a little fox, Kura, a sewer worker employed by the city. The rats are invading the sewers and damaging them. </h3>
            <h3>You must reach their leader while dodging his minions and traps, to make them leave.</h3>

            <h4>Description:</h4>
            <h3>GOOMS is the first game I created. It was developed over 6 months at ESMA Game, I was responsible for all aspects of the game.</h3>
            <h3>I was in charge of artistic side, level design, and of course, programming.</h3>
            <h3>This game was my entry point into video game development and made me realize that I love programming fun and engaging mechanics.</h3>

            <h4>Grab Mechanic:</h4>
            <h3>The main mechanic was simple: Grab specific elements with your mouse or controller.</h3>
            <h3>First of all, I had to track the cursor position and the Player's Input to determine if they wanted to grab a valid item.</h3>
            <h3>Then, I applied some physics to the selected elements to make a fun interactions, similar to the Gravity Gun from Garry's Mod.</h3>
            <h3>My goal was to achieve a smooth feel while maintaining a dynamic and fast-paced experience.</h3>
            <h3>I also added an option to freeze the held item in the air. This locked its rotation and location, so the Player could use it as a platform to progress through the sewer.</h3>
            
            <h4>IA:</h4>
            <h3>During this project, I had to develop several enemy AIs.</h3> 
            <h3>The first one was a chasing AI. I designed it to roam freely, and when it spotted the player, it would start chasing them until reaching them.</h3>
            <h3>Next, the shooting AI. I reused the sight system from the chasing AI to save development time and implemented a bullet system checking for possible</h3>
            <h3>collisions with the player or the environment. This allowed me to determine whether a bullet should be destroyed or deal damage.</h3>
            <h3>Finally, the diving AI, which was by far the most challenging. I had to make it calculate its path based on its surrounding and the player's position to execute a smooth</h3>
            <h3>diving motion along a curved trajectory. I experimented with many mathematical functions to achieve the desired movement and managed to apply it to the AI.</h3>
