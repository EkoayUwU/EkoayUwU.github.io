            <h4>Description:</h4>
            <h3>This project is my introduction to C++ in Unreal Engine.</h3>
            <h3>I tried to look as much as possible for documentations, forums, and tutorials to understand its basis.</h3>
            <h3>While doing this, I set myself a constraint, do everything in C++.</h3>
            <h3>So even latent event are handle in C++ even that I know that it's easier with blueprint.</h3>
            <h3>My aim with that was to learn as much as possible and it helped me to understand how to manage delay and specific timers.</h3>

            <h4>Realisation:</h4>
            <h3>First of all, I tried to understand how Enhanced Input Plugin works by setting up all the necessary buttons.</h3>
            <h3>Then, I thought about a system to handle each note individually so they could be self-managed.</h3>
            <h3>That's why I came up with a subclass of the notes that, at spawn, will initialize themselves with the desired input and start a timer</h3>
            <h3>to check if the correct input is pressed within the time window.</h3>
            <h3>The spawn system was handled by a Note Manager, which, upon spawning, shared it with the UI to display the notes and play the correct animation.</h3>
            
            <h4>Conclusion:</h4>
            <h3>This project was a great introduction to C++ and taught me a lot on class structures and how to handle multiple instances.</h3>
            <h3>It also gave me a better understanding of Delays & Timers and how they were managed by the C++ in Blueprint,</h3>
            <h3>and made my use the UMG system to build links between my code and the User Interface.</h3>
            <h3>This experience gave me a great practice in developing subclass that can manage themselves, helping to prevent any bugs, avoid unnecessary references, </h3>
            <h3>and possible memory leaks.</h3>
