            <h4>Synopsis:</h4>
            <h3>Ravenous is a psychological horror game in which you play as Louis, a child trapped in a monster's basement.</h3>
            <h3>Explore the mysterious abode, solve puzzles to save your little sister and survive the psychological nightmare prepared for you.</h3>

            <h4>Descriptif:</h4>
            <h3>Ravenous is a game created in 6 months at ESMA Game by 8 students, including me.</h3>
            <h3>In this project, I was the only Game Developer, and I was also in charge of creating the monster's rig.</h3>
            <h3>With this page, I'll try to describe as best as possible what I did during this project. Enjoy !</h3>

            <h4> </h4>
            <h4>Puzzle:</h4>
            <h3>In this project, my role was to bring to life every puzzle designed and ensure they were easy and smooth to use.</h3>
            <h3>There are a total of six puzzles, all functioning in a similar way.</h3>
            <h3>To solve them, you must find a specific object or perform certain actions to unlock the rest of the game.</h3>
            <h3> Players can rotate the puzzle in any direction, but it will revert to its default state at the end.</h3>

            <h4> </h4>
            <h3>Let me use the Panda as an example:</h3>
            <h3>Player interacts with it to try to pick up the drawing, but it is stuck under the drumsticks.</h3>
            <h3>Then, he must interact with the drumsticks to move them, but to do that, he first needs to rotate the Panda.</h3>
            <h3>He can finally gather the drawing and use it to solve the room's puzzle.</h3>
            
            <h4>Events:</h4>
            <h3>One of my role was to keep tracks of player's path to trigger various main events at specific times.</h3>
            <h3>Most of them were Monster appearances, but there were also events like unlocking Door, playing Music or SFX, and enable Dialogue.</h3>

            <h4>UI & Menus:</h4>
            <h3>I think that the hardest thing on this project was making it fully compatible with a Controller.</h3>
            <h3>I managed to do it by keeping track of Player's UI index to modify button appearances accordingly.</h3>
            <h3>To ensure a non-frustrating experience, I made sure the Player's focus remained on the UI, preventing any annoying or blocking situations.</h3>
            <h3>One of the most challenging tasks was ensuring a seamless switch between KB&M and Controller, which I achieved by managing Player's UI Focus,</h3>
            <h3>current UI state, and Inputs.</h3>

            <h4>Language System:</h4>
            <h3>We wanted the game to have at least English and French options to reach as many people as possible.</h3>
            <h3>I then started creating a fully modular Language System, allowing us to easily add new languages just as we later did with a Korean translation.</h3>
            <h3>This system required me to work with String Tables and learn how to load each sentence individually to prevent lag spikes.</h3>
            <h3>I also add to ensure the correct UI images were displayed based on the selected language at the game's start).</h3>
            
            <h4>Conclusions:</h4>
            <h3>Over these 6 months, my role was to ensure the game's playability under all circumstances.</h3>
            <h3>To guarantee the project's functionality, I followed various steps to develop the game's mechanics and ensure they worked effectively.</h3>
            <h3>I then, analyzed how they evolved within the level and interacted with each other, while incorporating player feedback from various playtest.</h3>
            <h3>Throughout this project, I went through several phases of testing and debugging to prevent any issues for players.</h3>
            <h3>Finally, I spent at least 2 months polishing theses mechanics and refining game's feel by adding visual and audio feedback to provide the best possible experience.</h3>
            <h3>In conclusion, this first real project on Unreal taught so much on game development and reinforced my desire to contribute to the creation of immersive and engaging games !</h3>
