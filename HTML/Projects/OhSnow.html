            <h4>Context:</h4>
            <h3>This game was made for the February 2024 Game Jam, which had the theme "Butterfly Effect".</h3>
            <h3>It was made by a group of students from Montpellier, France.</h3>
            <h3>With 11 other students, we worked together and made this game in 36 hours.</h3>
            <h3>It was my first Game Jam and also my first group work !</h3>

            <h4>My Role:</h4>
            <h3>During this Game Jam, my role was to dynamically generate the playground and the background.</h3>
            <h3>At first, I created a self moving ground to simulate the snowball's movement, but we later decided it was easier to keep the ground still and move the ball instead.</h3>
            <h3>To ease, Level Artist's work, I developed a simple system to build both playground and background by using a set of customizable panels used as presets,</h3>
            <h3>which were randomly spawn to simulate a real progression through the level.</h3>
            <h3>I also had to make and implement the Start and Victory events, and began working on an endless mode, but time was too short, so we couldn't include this functionality.</h3>
