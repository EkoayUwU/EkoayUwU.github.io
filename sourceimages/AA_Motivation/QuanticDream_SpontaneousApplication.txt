Subject: Spontaneous Application for a Junior Gameplay Programmer Internship

Dear Recruitment Manager,

As someone deeply fascinated by the mix of technology and storytelling, I am excited to apply for a Gameplay Programmer position at Quantic Dream. 
With a solid foundation in game development and a passion for pushing creative boundaries, I am eager to contribute to your team and help elevate the studio’s game system. 

During my studies at ESMA, where I completed a three-year Game Conception diploma, I worked on projects such as Nova, a Third-Person Contemplative game, made using Unreal Engine 5 using only C++, Ravenous, a First Person Horror game delivered with Unreal Engine 5 in Blueprint, and GOOMS, a 2D Platformer made with Unity in C#. These experiences allowed me to deepen my expertise in gameplay programming, AI behavior development, Game Systems, Data Management and collaborative problem-solving within multidisciplinary teams. 
Also, my background in 3D modelling, animation, and rigging further complements my programming skills, allowing me to understand and align technical solutions with artistic visions. 

Quantic Dream’s aim of crafting emotionally rich and technically innovative experiences like Detroit: Become Human or Beyond: Two Souls motivates me. The opportunity to contribute to the evolution of your game such as AI engine-enhancing NPC behaviors, gameplay decision-making systems, and collaborative tools-aligns with my goals. Collaborating closely with level designers, animators, 3D artists, and R&D experts to handle complex challenges excites me as a learner and a gameplay programmer. 

Additionally, I am a native French speaker and proficient in English, allowing me to communicate effectively in professional contexts. Joining Quantic Dream represents a chance to contribute to groundbreaking AAA projects while growing within a team renowned for its excellence and dedication. I am confident that my willingness to learn, creativity, and technical skills make me a good candidate for this role.

Thank you for considering my application. I'm available for an internship starting in July 2025 for a duration of 2 to 6 months. I have attached my CV and Portfolio for your review and would be delighted to discuss how my background and ambitions align with Quantic Dream’s vision. I look forward to your response.

Sincerely,
Ethan Gongora
