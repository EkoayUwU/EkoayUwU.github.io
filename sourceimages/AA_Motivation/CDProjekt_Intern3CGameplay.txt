Subject: Application for a Junior 3C's Gameplay Programmer Internship

Dear Recruitment Manager,

Passionate about the intersection of technology and storytelling, I am excited to apply for a Junior 3C's Gameplay Programmer Internship at CD Projekt Red. With a strong foundation in game development and a drive to push creative boundaries, I am eager to contribute to your team and help refine the studio’s game systems.

During my studies at ESMA, where I completed a three-year diploma in Game Conception, I worked on several projects, including Nova, a third-person contemplative game developed in Unreal Engine 5 using C++. Ravenous, a first-person horror game built in Unreal Engine 5 using Blueprint. And GOOMS, a 2D platformer developed in Unity with C#.
These experiences allowed me to deepen my expertise in gameplay programming, AI behavior development, game systems, data management, and collaborative problem-solving within multidisciplinary teams.

CD Projekt Red’s commitment to crafting rich worlds and technically innovative experiences, such as The Witcher and Cyberpunk 2077, inspires me. The opportunity to contribute to the evolution of your gameplay mechanics, immersive camera experiences, and engaging game systems aligns perfectly with my aspirations. Working closely with designers, animators, 3D artists, and R&D experts to tackle complex challenges excites me both as a learner and as a gameplay programmer.

Additionally, as a native French speaker proficient in English, I can communicate effectively in professional environments. Joining CD Projekt Red represents a unique opportunity to contribute to ambitious AAA projects while growing within a team renowned for its excellence, dedication and ambition. I am confident that my willingness to learn, creativity, and technical skills make me a good candidate for this role.

Thank you for considering my application. I am available for an internship starting in July 2025 for a duration of 2 to 6 months. I have attached my CV and portfolio for your review and would be delighted to discuss how my background and ambitions align with CD Projekt Red’s vision.

I look forward to your response.

Sincerely,
Ethan Gongora
